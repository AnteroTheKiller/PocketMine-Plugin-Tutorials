				Well, I guess, this is the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> version of PocketMine plugin tutorials from
				me?<br>
				I must admit that the versions before had not been very successful, so I guess we should start all over
				again.<br>
				This time, I created the tutorials with GitHub sites. Hopefully more customizable pages will help make
				the tutorials better.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, first of all, let's get to know clearly what we are planning to do.<br>
				<span class="note">Wait, aren't we going to code PocketMine plugins? Isn't that clear enough?</span><br>
				Then what exactly does a PocketMine plugin do? The answer could be quite vague.<br>
				Basically, a plugin has unlimited power (including root access if you are running the server with root)
				on your server. It is the commander of your server. Plugins instruct PocketMine to get everything done.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="note">
					So I know that the plugin is the god. But how does knowing that help me?
				</span><br>
				The problem that made most people unable to code is that most people don't know what they want.<br>
				<span class="note">I know very clearly. I want to make a hunger games plugin.</span><br>
				But then, what is a hunger games plugin?<br>

				The outline for a hunger games plugin actually shows three of the most important components of plugins:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Commands</li>
				<li>Events (when something happens)</li>
				<li>Timer</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Of course, we are nowhere near the complexity of a good hunger games plugin. But at least now we know
				better what we are going to do.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the <a href="#">second chapter</a> of this website, we will go through the principles of these three
				components, as well as some fundamental ways of doing various actions on the server.<br>
				But before that, we would start by creating <em>a useless plugin that works</em>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tree" data-name="Chapter 1 - A useless plugin that works">
			<div class="tree" data-name="Basic tools">
				It is hilarious for many times someone asks me to teach him/her plugin development, and after half an
				hour
				long talk of theory we decided to get our hands on getting something produced and realized that he/she
				did
				not have the necessary tools ready. Make sure you have everything in this <em>basic</em> checklist:
				<ul>
					<li>A PocketMine server that you can <em>directly</em> change its plugin files.<br>
						For testing plugins, obviously.
					</li>
					<li>
						A virtual/hard keyboard that can let you type symbols like
						<code class="code">,.;!?$/\|()[]{}</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Yes, that's all. If that's all the resources you got, you could still code plugins, but with very hard
				time.<br>
				Here is a list of <em>recommended</em> tools:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Text editor</strong><br>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Windows</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										If you are thinking about <em>Microsoft Word</em>, get rid of that thought
										immediately. Microsoft Word is a rich text editor, and it simply cannot open nor
										output any text files. Same applies to <em>WordPad</em> that came in Windows'
										<em>Accessories</em>.<br>
									</li>
									<li>
										You may be thinking about <em>NotePad</em> that came in the <em>Accessories</em>
										with Windows. Well, it is the best option if you can't install anything on your
										computer. (But then how did you install PocketMine?)
									</li>
									<li>
										The recommended tool is <em><a
											href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a></em>. It is a powerful
										text editor for many types of files and for different programming languages.
									</li>
									<li>
										Some would recommend NetBeans, but I wouldn't want you to waste time doing all
										the setup stuff. Believe me, setup for a program always makes anything
										interesting into boring.
									</li>
									<li>
										If you have heard of PhpStorm, again, same with NetBeans, setup trouble
										(although there isn't a lot). Moreover, it is paid software, although there are
										some ways to legitimately get it for free. Nevertheless, it is an all-powerful
										IDE that completes the code for you when you have provided a little hint, and
										can also be used for other things like coding websites, etc. Actually, this
										website was written using PhpStorm (although there is no PHP here).
									</li>
									<li><strong>Browser + GitHub</strong>
										The GitHub editor for code is not bad, at least better than Windows Notepad, but
										it is far not as good as PhpStorm. If you don't like installing anything, this
										is a good alternative to Notepad++.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>OS X</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>I have never used OS X, so don't ask me :(</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>iOS</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>I have never used iOS, so don't ask me :(</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Android</strong><br>
								I would not advise coding on phones or tablets, but if you don't have an alternative,
								well...
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Normal text editors</strong><br>
										Whatever editor you like, as long as it disables autocorrect. You can try <em>Text
											Editor</em> embedded in the <em>File Manager</em> app.<br>
										BTW, you need a file explorer since plugins consist of more than one file when
										you are developing.
									</li>
									<li><strong>Vim Touch</strong><br>
										It is an imitation of <em>Vim</em> for Linux. It is an odd choice, but it has
										good things if you
									</li>
									<li><strong>Chrome + GitHub</strong>
										Many mobile users found GitHub's direct edit interface good, although it isn't
										at all.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>A browser</strong><br>
						For you to look for documentation (and this website) anytime you have trouble. Believe me,
						nobody memorizes all the functions in PHP.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Yes, this simple. That's all you need. But again, I strongly encourage you to get a computer and a
					hard keyboard, or you can hardly develop anything big without finding all your <code class="code">$this</code>
					becoming <code class="code">$thos</code>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="tree" data-name="Setting up plugin manifest">
				<p>
					I would assume that you have PocketMine setup already. I hope I don't need to teach you how to find
					that directory.<br>
					<span class="note">Fine. For Android it is <code class="code">~/PocketMine</code>, where <code class="code">~</code> is something
						like <code class="code">/mnt/sdcard</code>, etc.</span><br>
					Navigate to the <code class="code">plugins</code> directory (a.k.a. folder) and install the <a
						href="https://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins/devtools.515/">DevTools</a> plugin.<br>
					For our first plugin, we are going to call it <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code>. Now, create a directory in
					the <code class="code">plugins</code> directory called <code class="code">FirstPlugin</code>. So now we have <code class="code">/plugins/FirstPlugin</code>.
					For convenience, in the future we are going to call this path <code class="code">~</code>. E.g. <code class="code">~/plugin.yml</code>
					refers to <code class="code">/plugins/FirstPlugin/plugin.yml</code>.<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now, it is time to create the very first file of our plugin. But it is not PHP code. It is a <em>YAML</em>
					file that describes your plugin, located at <code class="code">~/plugin.yml</code>.<br>
				</p>
				<pre><code class="codefence" data-language="yaml">
name: FirstPlugin
version: 1.0.0
api: [1.13.0]
main: FirstPlugin\FirstPlugin
